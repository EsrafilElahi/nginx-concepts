# What it is: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers for scalability and fault tolerance.
# Use Case: Handle high traffic or distribute load between multiple app instances.

# Explanation: Nginx will round-robin requests between the 3 backend servers.
# Helps balance traffic, reduce load on each server.
